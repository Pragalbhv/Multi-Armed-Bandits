Q1: Randomizing the Leader:  Problem of online learning on the simplex:- Implemented FTRL with quadratic and entropic regularization for this problem

Q2:Mean Wise Variance Foolish:  Implemented the EXP3 algorithm  and ran it for 1000 times for 10,000 iterations each and plot the regret along with error bars. 

Q3:Epsilon Greedy Implemented theepsilon-greedy algorithm and an EXP-3 algorithm and an algorithm Explore then commit) that chooses an arm in a greedy fashion at every round (i.e.,epsilon= 0) afterplaying each arm once in a round robin fashion
