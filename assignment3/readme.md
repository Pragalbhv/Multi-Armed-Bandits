Q1:Gaussian Explore Then Commit:  Investigated the empirical behaviour of the Explore then Commit algorithm when the loss of the two arms are standard Gaussian random variables with meanμ1= 0 and μ2= ∆. optimalFunction  that  takes T and δ as  input  and  returns  the optimal number of rounds T0 needed for exploration which minimizes the regret.

Q2: Thompson vs UCB: Adapted  the  Upper Confidence Bounds  and  Thompson  sampling  algorithms  to  work  for  this setting
