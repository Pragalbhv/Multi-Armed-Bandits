What are Multiarmed Bandits?
"In probability theory and machine learning, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K-or N-armed bandit problem) is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. This is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the explorationâ€“exploitation tradeoff dilemma." _Wikipedia


Applications of Multiarmed Bandits:-
* Netflix Item based recommender systems: Images related to movies/shows are shown to users in such a way that they are more likely to watch it.
* Bidding and Stock Exchange: Predicting Stocks based on Current data of stock prizes.
* Traffic Light Control: Predicting the delay in signal.
* Automation in Industries: Bots and Machines for transporting and Delivering items without human intervention. _geeksforgeeks
* In recent years, multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework has attracted a lot of attention in various applications, from recommender systems and information retrieval to healthcare and finance, due to its stellar performance combined with certain attractive properties, such as learning from less feedback. _ arXiv:1904.10040v1
